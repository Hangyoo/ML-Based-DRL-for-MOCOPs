Due to the large amount of data required for training the deep learning model, the files are too large to be uploaded to GitHub. Therefore, only examples of the training data for each MOCOP are provided here. The full dataset can be downloaded from BaiduNetdisk.

For ease of model training, the city demand and item weight have been normalized (actual value / capacity). Accordingly, both the vehicle capacity and the backpack capacity are set to 1.0.
