# An Effective Cross-Task Unified Multi-Objective Neural Meta-Framework for Solving Diverse Combinatorial Problems

## Code to be uploaded... The related code will be provided later.

This repository contains the training and testing data for five Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) problems, along with the experimental results and corresponding true Pareto fronts (where available).
- Multi-Objective Travelling Salesman Problem (MOTSP)
- Multi-Objective Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (MOVRPTW)
- Multi-Objective Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MOCVRP)
- Multi-Objective Knapsack Problem (MOKP)
- Multi-Objective Open Vehicle Routing Problem (MOOVRP)

# Directory Structure
### Training Data
Due to the large size of the training data (>1GB) and GitHub's file size limitations, we have uploaded the training data to BaiduNetdisk. The data is divided into four compressed files: `MOTSP_training_data`, `MOCVRP_training_data`, `MOVRPTW_training_data`, and `MOKP_training_data`. Note: Our model is trained only on the `MOTSP`, `MOCVRP`, `MOVRPTW`, and `MOKP` datasets, and it generalizes to solve the `MOOVRP` using a zero-shot approach. Therefore, the `MOOVRP` is not included in the training data but is part of the test set. You can download the training data from the following link:

Access Code: `rudd`

To make it easier for users to understand the format of the training data, we have also uploaded example files, each containing 20 training instances (Note: All instance data is normalized to the range [0, 1] to facilitate training):
-   **MOTSPP_training_data_example.txt**:  
    > Contains 4 columns: the first two are used to compute the first objective, and the last two are for the second objective.
    
-   **MOCVRP_training_data_example.txt**:  
    > Contains 3 columns: the first two represent city coordinates, and the third represents demand. The vehicle capacity is set to 1.
    
-   **MOVRPTWP_training_data_example.txt**:  
    > Contains 6 columns: the first two represent city coordinates, and the other four represent demand, earliest service time, latest service time, and service duration, respectively. The vehicle capacity is set to 1.0.
    
-   **MOKP_training_data_example.txt**:  
    > Contains 3 columns: the first column represents item weight, and the second and third columns correspond to the two values of the item. The vehicle capacity is set to 1, and the knapsack capacity is set to 1.0.
    
### Test Data
We provide two types of test data:
1.  Benchmark Test Set
2.  Random Test Set

# Experimental Results

We report the results obtained by our algorithm on all test instances of each MOCO problem.

## Comparison Algorithms
###  Learning-based comparison algorithms
We have selected the five best learning-based algorithms for solving MOCOPs to date as comparison algorithms, as detailed below:

### Exact and heuristic comparison algorithms
For each MOCOP, we have selected the best 2-3 algorithms (including iteration-based heuristics and exact algorithms) that have addressed the corresponding MOCOP to date as comparison algorithms, as detailed below:
